This script has to be run before build, outside from container
--------------------------------------------------------------

- This script does nothing in this example

- This script would download the testgl/ content
  (which is already included as example)



When starting building the container, using one of the -build-nvidia-
scripts,

- user-preinstall is executed inside the container before main build
- main build is started (in this example, testgl/requirements.txt with PyPI,
                         environment.yaml with conda can also be managed)
- user-postinstall is executed inside the container after build



The application is started by the -runvnc- script:
- a vnc server is started
- instructions to view it is given on console
- container is started
- the local and always outside-from-container \`run-in-container\` script is run by the container
